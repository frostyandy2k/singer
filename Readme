# Translation of the Singer Manual

So I just bought my grandma a sewing machine and because she forgot most of her english and german I wanted to translate the manual for her.

Good thing there's Google Translate, unfortunately you cannot upload PDF to it (nor have I found other supported upload formats). Hovewer you can use Google Docs for the auto translation (Tools->Translate).

So how do you get from the PDF to the translated Doc?

1. Transform the PDF to something where you can get the Text out:
Many thanks to http://www.zamzar.com for an amazing automatic conversion from PDF to stunning HTML.
1. Get the Text somehow into Google Docs
I had to use a 'select all text on webpage' tool to get the text out due to the fact that zamzar packages text in a lot of divs. I found this chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/select-all-text/gmjlokoefabnajhinmejngadmbocdink/related
1. Fix issues with the import and then Tools->Translate

Sample versions can be found in this repository.

While it's not perfect, it's good enough. Happy sewing grandma! Love you! 

Google Docs version so you can translate into your own language:
